Project: A Web Application for Smart Car Selection Based on Customizable Parameters.
# Introduction
This project involved the development and deployment of a public-facing web application designed to assist users in selecting a car that best fits their needs based on a dataset of car sales advertisements. Hosted on a cloud platform, the application provides a user-friendly interface to filter cars by price range, condition, and distance driven, allowing users to tailor their search to find their ideal vehicle.

The application offers the following features:

**Customizable Search:** Users can filter cars by specifying a price range in slider and a checkbox option to show only listings in "New," "Like New," and "Excellent" condition. <br>
**Dynamic Data Insights:** Filtered search results include a breakdown by car condition and price in scatter plot and histogram displaying the distribution of distance driven for the selected cars. <br>
**Recommendations List:** Users receive a final list of recommended cars based on their specified criteria.

This tool streamlines the car selection process, providing potential buyers with a curated list of vehicles to help them make informed purchasing decisions.Â¶
